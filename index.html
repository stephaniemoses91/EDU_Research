								<p style="font-size: 20px;">The prevalence of depression in adolescents has significantly increased in recent years. 
									According to the National Institution of Mental Health (2019), over three million adolescents in the United States 
									had at least one Major Depressive Episode (MDE) in 2017. This represents 13.3% of adolescents in the country between the age 
									of 12 and 17. </p>

									<p style="font-size: 20px;">

									Below are some statistics to gain a deeper understanding of the issue,<br/>
									• Recent surveys indicate as many as one in five teens suffer from clinical depression (Mental Health America, 2020).<br />
									• A survey conducted among children aged 13 to 17 found that academic and social pressures are key contributors to anxiety and depression (Pew Research Center, 2019). <br/>
									• Six in ten teens felt they were under immense pressure to get good grades and three in ten teens felt under pressure to look good and fit in socially (Pew Research Center, 2019). <br/>
									• Research indicates a link between increased use of social media and depression among adolescents (Child mind Institute, 2019). <br />
									• Teenage and young adult users who spend more time in Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms were shown to have a substantially higher rate of reported depression compared to those who spend less time online (Child mind Institute, 2019).<br />
									</p>
									<p style="font-size: 20px;">
									Depression is evidently a rapidly growing concern and taking a closer look at the statistics leads us to an inevitable question. Do adolescents receive adequate mental health support from their immediate environment to fight depression? <br />
									
									Children typically spend six to seven hours each day in school for nearly ten months a year, which means they possibly spend more time interacting with their teachers than with their parents (Wolk, 2008). This indicates the magnitude of
									the impact and influence teachers can have on children and their wellbeing. Given that, it is compelling to take a closer look at today’s teaching force to explore their role in supporting children’s mental health. <br />
									
									• The number of white students in schools has dropped from 62% in 1999 to 47% in 2018 (National Center for Education Statistics, 2018) <br />
									• Approximately 52% of students in secondary schools represent cultural minorities.<br />
									• This means that over half of the students in American public schools are children of color. <br />
									• However, 84% of the teaching force still remains white (Data USA, 2018). <br /></p>
									
									<p style="font-size: 20px;">
									The above statistics indicate a large cultural gap between teachers and students despite the growing diversity in classrooms. <br />
									
									Therefore, the teacher candidate intends to explore the possible impact of the cultural gap between students and teachers on the increasing rates of depression among adolescents. <br />
									The research synthesis is guided by below questions,<br />
									1. Can a more culturally diverse teaching force help adolescents fight depression? <br />
									2. Does culture impact the relationship between teachers and adolescents?<br />
									3. Can a strong relationship between teachers and adolescent students help teachers sense an early onset of depression among their students? Can this prevent MDE among adolescent students?</p>

						<!-- Interest -->
							<article id="Interest">
								<h2 class="major">Interest</h2>
								<span class="image main" ><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="font-size: 20px;">The teacher candidate selected this topic because she has experience working in an elementary school with a highly diverse student population. 
									However, the teaching staff in the school were predominantly white. There were many instances where a clear disconnect was witnessed between 
									students and teachers. A deeper understanding of some student-teacher disagreements almost always had a certain level of cultural insensitivity 
									at the root of it. Being a part of a minority culture herself, the teacher candidate was able relate to this discrepancy. 
									This led her to ponder on similar challenges faced by secondary school students, who need stronger relationships with teachers due to the increased 
									complexities associated with adolescence. This interested and influenced the teacher candidate to examine if addressing the cultural gap between 
									teachers and students would help adolescents cope with the mental health triggers that lead to depression.</p>

						<!-- Proposed Study -->
							<article id="ProposedStudy">
								<h2 class="major">PROPOSED STUDY</h2>
								<span class="image main" ><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="font-size: 20px;">I propose a longitudinal study using quantitative research methods to address the current gap in literature on this topic.<br/>
									• The sample of will represent students of Hispanic, Asian, Indian and African American descents<br/>
									• The study will identify racial identity of each of their teachers and monitor impact<br/>
									• A combination of self-administered surveys and structured interviews will be used to collect data<br/>
									• Some of the participants will be identified as at risk for depression to examine the impact of student-teacher relationship on them<br/>
									• This design of research is appropriate the student-teacher relationships and symptoms of depression in students can be observed over a period of time to analyze the relationship between the variables. 
									The results can be statistically quantified and generalized to the larger population.</p>

											<br/><br/>
											<h2 style="text-align: center; ">Shortcomings of existing research </h2><br/>
														<p style ="text-align: center;">Results of existing research reflect the prevalence of negative beliefs among teachers about students of cultural minorities and the disproportionate 
															behaviour of teachers towards children of colour. However, most studies related to this topic have been conducted on black students. 
															There is a definite need for studies on other cultural minorities like Hispanic, Asian and Indian students, as there is a rapid growth in the number 
															of students representing these cultures in classrooms (NCES, 2018). 
															Further, there are many studies that indicate the positive impact of student-teacher relationships on students’ behaviour and mental health. 
															However, these studies have not taken the racial identities of teachers into consideration. 
															They don’t specifically examine which teachers had positive relationships with students. 
															Hence, we are unable to fully understand if the racial identity of teachers impacts teacher-student relationships.</p>
