								<p style="font-size: 20px;">The prevalence of depression in adolescents has significantly increased in recent years. 
									According to the National Institution of Mental Health (2019), over three million adolescents in the United States 
									had at least one Major Depressive Episode (MDE) in 2017. This represents 13.3% of adolescents in the country between the age 
									of 12 and 17. </p>

									<video style="width: 700px; display: block;"autoplay loop muted playsinline src="images/Presentation1.mp4"></video>

									<p style="font-size: 20px;">

										<br/><br/>
									Below statistics offer a deeper understanding of the issue.</p>
									<ul style="padding: left 25px; font-size: 20px;" >
										<li>Recent surveys indicate that as many as one in five teens suffer from clinical depression (Mental Health America, 2020).<br /></li>
										<li>A survey conducted among children aged 13 to 17 found that academic and social pressures are key contributors to anxiety and depression (Pew Research Center, 2019). <br/></li>
										<li>Six in ten teens felt they were under immense pressure to get good grades and three in ten teens felt under pressure to look good and fit in socially (Pew Research Center, 2019). <br/></li>
										<li>Research indicates a link between increased use of social media and depression among adolescents (Child Mind Institute, 2019). <br /></li>
										<li>Teenage and young adult users who spend more time in Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms were shown to have a substantially higher rate of reported depression compared to those who spend less time online (Child Mind Institute, 2019).<br /></li>
									</ul>
					
									<p style="font-size: 20px;">
									Depression among adolescents is evidently a rapidly growing concern and taking a closer look at the statistics leads us to an inevitable question. Do adolescents receive adequate mental health support from their immediate environment to fight depression? <br />
									<br/>
									Children typically spend six to seven hours each day in school for nearly ten months a year, which means they possibly spend more time interacting with their teachers than with their parents (Wolk, 2008). This indicates the magnitude of
									impact and influence teachers can have on adolescent students. Thus, it is compelling to take a closer look at today’s teaching force in order to explore their role in supporting the mental health of adolescents.<br />
								</p>
									<ul style="padding: left 25px; font-size: 20px;" >
									<li>The number of white students in schools has dropped from 62% in 1999 to 47% in 2018 (National Center for Education Statistics[NCES], 2018).<br /></li>
									<li>Approximately 52% of students in secondary schools represent cultural minorities (NCES, 2018).<br /></li>
									<li>This means that over half of the students in American public schools are children of color.<br /></li>
									<li>However, 84% of the teaching force remains white (Data USA, 2018).<br /></li>
									</ul>
									<p style="font-size: 20px;">
									The above statistics indicate a large cultural gap between teachers and students despite the growing diversity in classrooms.
									Therefore, the teacher candidate intends to explore the possible impact of the cultural gap between students and teachers on the increasing rates of depression among adolescents. <br />
									The research synthesis is guided by below questions,<br />
									<ol style="padding: left 25px; font-size: 20px;" >
									<li>Can a more culturally diverse teaching force help adolescents fight depression? <br /></li>
									<li>Does culture impact the relationship between teachers and adolescents?<br /></li>
									<li>Can a strong relationship between teachers and adolescent students help teachers sense an early onset of depression among their students? Can this prevent MDE among adolescent students?</p></li>

						<!-- Interest -->
							<article id="Interest">
								<h2 class="major">Interest</h2>
								<span class="image main" ><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="font-size: 20px;">The teacher candidate selected this topic because she has experience working in an elementary school with a highly diverse student population 
									and a predominantly white teaching force. During her tenure there, she witnessed several instances where a clear disconnect was seen between teachers and students. 
									Further, a deeper understanding of some teacher-student disagreements most often indicated a certain level of cultural insensitivity at the root of it. 
									Being a person of color herself, the teacher candidate was able to relate to this disconnect. In view of her future role as a teacher in one of the most diverse cities in the country, 
									she wanted to explore this phenomenon further and understand how addressing the cultural gap in schools can impact the increasing mental health issues among adolescents.</p>

						<!-- Proposed Study -->
							<article id="ProposedStudy">
								<h2 class="major">Proposed study</h2>
								<span class="image main" ><img style="height: 350px;" src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p style="font-size: 20px;">A longitudinal study using quantitative research methods is proposed to address the current gap in literature on this topic.<br/>
									<ul style="padding: left 25px; font-size: 20px;" >
									<li>The sample will represent students of Hispanic, Asian, Indian and African American descents.<br/></li>
									<li>The study will investigate the racial identity of the participants’ teachers.<br/></li>
									<li>A combination of self-administered surveys and structured interviews will be used to collect data.<br/></li>
									<li>This design of research is appropriate as the cultural gap between teachers and students and teacher-student 
										relationships can be observed along with the concurrent longitudinal impact of these factors on depression among adolescents. 
										Further, the data can be quantified, statistically analyzed and generalized to the larger population of adolescents.</li>

											</ul>
											<br/><br/>
											<h2 style="text-align: center; ">Shortcomings of existing research </h2><br/>
														<p style ="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">Results of existing research reflect the prevalence of negative beliefs among teachers about students of cultural minorities. 
															Teachers are also seen to behave disproportionately more negative towards children of colour. However, most studies related to this topic have been conducted on black students. 
															There is a definite need for studies on students of Hispanic, Asian and Indian descent, as the representation of these cultures in classrooms has significantly increased 
															in the recent years (NCES, 2018). Further, there are many studies that indicate the positive impact of teacher-student relationships on students’ behaviour and mental health. 
															However, these studies have not taken the racial identities of teachers into consideration. They don’t specifically examine which teachers had positive relationships 
															with students. Hence, we are unable to fully understand if the racial identity of teachers impacts teacher-student relationships.</p>
